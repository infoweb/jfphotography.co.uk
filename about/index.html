					<h2>No job is too small!</h2>
					<p>
						I have loved photography from a very young age – I was fascinated by the concept of seeing the
						people and things around me in a different way.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although I didn't know it at the time, my career really got going whilst I was a nanny in the
						US, and started snapping children, and found I had a talent for getting them to laugh and pose
						naturally. I got some wonderful shots, and created a darkroom for my black and white prints in
						the bathroom!
					</p>
					<p>
						When I returned to the UK I worked for my Professional Photographers' Certificate, and after a
						few years working in professional labs, I launched my own business in 1997 and have never looked
						back.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have done all sorts of work including commercial, fundraising, conferences, actors/amateur
						dramatics. In particular I love working with the local schools and nurseries and I have had
						several of the older youngsters doing work experience with me which has been great fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my spare time I have worked as a volunteer with my local Library, fundraising and running
						activities and outings for local people and helped out at a local parent and toddler group. I
						enjoy sewing and craft and also I love to spend time down on my allotment growing vegatables and
						herbs.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my years of working for myself I have travelled extensively around the world. One of my
						dearest memories is helping in a hospital for disabled children in Guatemala .
					</p>
					<p>
						I like to capture a child in their true essence, portray the joy and happiness that children
						give us all with a beautiful smile. Most of my work is very to the camera so when looking at
						your portrait it is like the person is connecting with you.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have any questions regarding my work please do not hesitate to get in touch, it would be
						lovely to hear from you!

										Not only was everyone totally at ease having their photos taken, they were still

										ourselves being photographed as the day went on. Well done Jackie an achievement
										in its self.</p>

									<p>The quality and variety of the pictures was amazing and all my family loved the
